I took a $6000/year pay cut coming from another hospital in KS and after having worked here for 3 years am still not up to what I was making as a new grad. Additionally, we use a version of Meditech which is extremely outdated. They keep saying ""we're going to 'update',"" but the version we are using was made in 1985 and they just keep adding code to it to make it fit the charting requirements set by JAHCO. This means who ever is doing the code will be the one to decide how we have to chart. For example, on 'yes or no' questions, to answer 'yes' on some question it's 'y', others '1', and still others it's '0'. There is no standard answer, we can't free text everything we need. We spend hours working on our charting. It's incredibly glitchy. And upper management does NOTHING to fix the problem. They won't give us a more competitive salary because the ""market"" (which is only the other hospitals in Wichita) says we are being paid well (but we haven't gotten a cost of living raise in a few years, even though cost of living has been increasing). They won't fix our computers. We aren't stocked well. And they wonder why people are leaving in droves.",3/15/17 19:14,3/15/17 19:37
